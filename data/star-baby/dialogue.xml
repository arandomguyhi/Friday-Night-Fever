	<action msg="Anyways, there's been word of a 'monster' lurking near here..." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="This part of town hasn't been renovated like the others, so it's still a bit... abandoned." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Luckily, there's no such things as monsters, so I'm guessing it's just some silly rumor." portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="You... do realize that I'm from space, right?" portrait="tea" emotion="pointing"/>

	<action msg="Your point?" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="Ugh, nevermind. Let's just get this over with. You sure this the right building" portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I can't say for sure. Every building on this side of town looks the goddamn same. Is there a light switch?" portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="Can't you summon some cool demon fire magic or something?" portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="The only fire I can summon is from my love for you." portrait="fever" emotion="hey"/>
	<action msg="I dunno... probably not as hot as actual fire..." portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="I can prove it." portrait="fever" emotion="hey"/>

	<action msg="Uh, hey. You uh, live here?" portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Maybe I do. Why, you here to kick me out?" portrait="wee" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Nah, it's not like that. We're looking for a monster." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="..." portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Hey, don't I know you?" portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="?" portrait="wee" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Oh, shoot- Tea? I was wondering if you were actually in this town or not." portrait="wee" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Huh? You know the cat?" portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="Yeah, Wee and I used to hang out a LONG time ago on a different planet." portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="Uh, cool." portrait="fever" emotion="embarrassed"/>
	<action msg="Well, if I were to guess, whoever made the report must've mistaken Wee for a monster or something." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Makes sense, nothing weirder than a talking cat." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="A monster? Hm... I have seen something like that around here." portrait="wee" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="But hey, is that a microphone?" portrait="wee" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I already see where this is going." portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="I dunno... I'm kind of on a schedule here..." portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>

	<action msg="Oh nah- now you've said too much!" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
