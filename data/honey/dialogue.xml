	<action msg="Psychotic nun? Talking fruit? Horny shapeshifter? Dealing with the raccoons?" portrait="tea" emotion="thinking"/>
	<action msg="This one's new. Someone in town gave me a letter, and told them to go to this spot at this time." portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="So, you're just gonna do it?" portrait="tea" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Might as well. Not like I had much to do. It's at the beach, too." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Call me crazy, but I feel like this handwritings familiar... letter smells nice, too." portrait="fever" emotion="ugh"/>
	<action msg="And anyways, I kinda have to, y'know." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="That rule where you HAVE to accept all challenges is pretty lame." portrait="tea" emotion="pointing"/>
	<action msg="Yeah, yeah- I know, hell. I'll change it soon, maybe after this." portrait="fever" emotion="embarrassed"/>
	<action msg="Let's just go." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="There sure are a lot of limos in this parking lot." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="So you're Tea. I've heard a bit about the both of you together already. Taking the world by storm, huh?" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I'm Hunni, but there's no need to tell you my name." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Cause after I beat you, the rest of the world will soon know." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Anyways, it's been a while huh Fever? Doesn't seem like you got much taller from the last time we met, though." portrait="cherry" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Not fair to say that when you're on top of that limo." portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="Then why dont you two hurry up and get on that one? Unless you're already intimidated by our aura?" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Pfft, intimidated? As if! Tea and I are a power couple, there's nothing that could-" portrait="fever" emotion="hey"/>
	<action msg="EUGH." portrait="tea" emotion="tea-point-wtf"/>
	<action msg="WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?" portrait="tea" emotion="tea-point-wtf"/>

	<action msg="I guess you can say I'm their leader in a way." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="That's cute. Y'know, once you get past the fact they're freakishly large. Reminds me of..." portrait="fever" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Large bunnies? That's fucking freaky." portrait="tea" emotion="tea-point-wtf"/>
	<action msg="Yeah, no, I think I'll just chill in the limo rather than on it." portrait="tea" emotion="pointing"/>
	<action msg="Power couple, huh?" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral" setBG=""/>
	<action msg="You know it!" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="I wasn't expecting this either... but hey, this just tips the scales in my favor. Not like you had any chance against me anyway." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="I don't need someone backing me up to win! Tea's just a bonus!" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="A very, very hot bonus." portrait="fever" emotion="hey"/>
	<action msg="I can respect that mentality. I'm also used to having the most lovely individual in the world cheering me on~." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Aww! Hunni-" portrait="cherry" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="This cute bunny! And this one, and this one! Come to me! You're all gonna dance so well!" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Bitch." portrait="cherry" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="Whatever! You can have them cheer you on all you want, it won't make a difference either way!" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="You sure are confident. Reminds me of an earlier time, huh?" portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>

	<action msg="Huh? Who was-" portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="The driver, obviously. Don't mind her." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
	<action msg="So, these aren't your limos?..." portrait="fever" emotion="point"/>
	<action msg="I rented them. Nevermind that, let's continue." portrait="hunni" emotion="neutral"/>
